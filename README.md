Description
===========

The goal is to provide simple scripts to install an amd64 Debian installation (default: buster)
in qemu image from an install with PXE and a preseed.

Dependencies
============


```
$ apt install qemu-utils qemu-system-x86 qemu-kvm curl python3
```

Technical
=========

1. The `build_qemu_debian_image.sh <distro_name>` script will create a temporary directory and generate password
1. Create a Simple webserver to serve the `preseed.cfg` file (not need to tftp)
1. Download `netboot.tar.gz` from Debian repo
1. Create the pxe configuration
1. Create the qemu image
1. Boot using the qemu image, pxe and preseed


`boot.sh <distro_name>` will boot on the newly created image.

To use a different version of Debian, update the `preseed.cfg` configuration:
```
d-i mirror/suite string buster
```

Known error
===========

If you get the following error:
```
No kernel modules were found. This probably is due to a mismatch between the
kernel used by this version of the installer and the kernel version available
in the archive.
```
It is caused by a mismatch between the kernel used in the installer
and the package not available on the repository.
Use https://d-i.debian.org/daily-images/ instead.
